Kyle WilsonPFWA I Week Four HomeworkPseudo code for advanced object homeworkCreate two JS files for separate code. Main.js and Person.jsIn Main.js- Create an array that will hold the names of five individuals- Use a Math.random to pick names from the names array for the Person object- Create a for loop that will cycle through the Person object three times- Store this information in an array called people- Create a conditional statement that will tell if there are any duplications on the                        name- Create a function that will output the person’s name and job onto the webpage- Set up an interval system that runs an update function from the constructor prototype on the Person.js file- This should change the persons action each time the function is ran- This new information will then populate onto the HTML page each time (See code for this in Person.js)In Person.js- Set the Person object to the global window so the Main.js file can find and use it- Create the Person object and add two variables to it, Person,jobs and Person.actions- Create four properties that will hold the info and calculations (Math.random) for the needed columns within the constructor- These four properties include name, action, job, and row. Some of them do have methods that will calculate items from a specific array.- Create an update function that can be referenced in the Main.js file for the action interval system. This will be added to the prototype. - The update function will display onto the HTML file in column three
